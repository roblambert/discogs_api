== DiscogsApi

Rails plugin that provides simple access to the Discogs 2.0 API (see http://www.discogs.com/help/api)

This plugin simply retrieves JSON from the Discogs API and wraps the response in a Hashie::Mash
to return pseudo-objects that have method-like accessors.

  script/rails plugin install git://github.com/roblambert/discogs_api.git

To install as a Rails 2 plugin:

Dependencies are managed with Bundler, make sure it is installed:

=== Example Usage

  #Provide your own unique user-agent when creating a DiscogsApi instance
  discogs_api = DiscogsApi.new "YourUserAgent/VERSION +http://YourWebsite"
  
  # Get an artist
  artist = discogs_api.get_artist("Van Halen")

  # inspect the artist
  puts "Yay, retrieved #{artist.name}."
  puts "Their primary website is #{artist.urls.first}."
  puts "Their first release listed in the response is #{artist.releases.first.title}"
  puts " which was released on #{artist.releases.first.label}"

  sleep 1 # :) Discogs asks that you do not hit the service more than once a second from an IP address!

  # Let's find more information about the first release listed in the artist object...
  release = discogs_api.get_release(artist.releases.first.id)
  puts "A little more info about this release: #{release.notes}"
  puts "The track listing for #{release.title} by #{release.artists.first.name} is: "
  release.tracklist.each do |track|
    puts " #{track.position}) #{track.title} [#{track.duration}]"
  end
