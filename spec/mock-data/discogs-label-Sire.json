{"resp": {"status": true, "version": "2.0", "label": {"profile": "American record label founded by [a=Seymour Stein] and [a=Richard Gottehrer] in 1966. The label was acquired by Warner Music Group in 1980.\r\n\r\nIn the 1970s, Sire was one of the first large independent labels to sign artists from the burgeoning punk and NYC new wave scene, including The [a=Ramones], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Dead+Boys,+The]The Dead Boys[/url] and [a=Talking Heads].\r\n\r\nOriginally pressed and distributed by London Records from 1968 to 1972; it switched to Dot Records/Famous Music later in 1972. Distribution again changed in 1974, this time to ABC Records. \r\n\r\nIn 1978, a distribution deal was signed with [l=Warner Bros. Records], and Warner finally purchased the label in 1980. Many Sire albums were put out through the Warner subsidiary [l=Reprise Records]. \r\n\r\nIn 1995, Sire temporarily switched distribution from Warner Brothers and Reprise to [l=Elektra], always remaining part of the [l=Warner Music Group]. \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Sire Records and the US division of [l=London Records], which came to the Warner fold when Roger Ames was hired to run all of Warner Music, were merged to become [l=London-Sire Records], part of Warner Music Group. This partnership was dissolved in April, 2003, at which point Sire once again became a distinct imprint in the portfolio of Warner-owned labels and returned to the aegis of Warner Bros. Records.\r\n\r\nLabel Code: [b]LC 3228[/b]\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n[u]A NOTE ON CATALOGUE NUMBERS:[/u]\r\nMany releases on this label will have two separate catalogue numbers.  Catalogue numbers printed on the packaging are typically in the format 9 [b]#####[/b]-[i]#[/i], while numbers printed on the media itself are typically in the format [i]#[/i]-[b]#####[/b].  For example, a release listed as 0-12345 on the center label of a record may also be listed as 9 12345-0 on the picture sleeve.  Please be sure to doublecheck both versions of the catalogue number before attempting to add your release, to prevent duplicates.  If both numbers are listed on a release, enter the [i]#[/i]-[b]#####[/b] form on the first label line, and the 9 [b]#####[/b]-[i]#[/i] form on the second label line.\n", "parentLabel": "Warner Bros.
